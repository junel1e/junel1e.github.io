--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

13/13
- 1/1 Readme

- 3/3 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
- There is multiple images all with descriptive alt text
- I use appropriate headings and paragraph text with each section on the home page
- There are links to external pages i.e. LinkedIn, Github
- I made multiple pages for my works and there is appropriate navigation between them
- There is a footer tag on every page
- Custom icons are used on the home page and footer via boxicons.com

(b) CSS features
- Content is indented because the padding and margins are modified
- The color of headings and other elements are modified to be the accent color
- Table layouts are implemented to display content in a more interesting manner

(c) Advanced features
- A navigation bar is incorporated, and the presence of a sidebar on all pages is contingent upon the dimensions of the interface.


3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
I've been meaning to make a portfolio for my designs for a long time so I worked to make the website my version of 'perfect'.
I started on Jan 10th and worked on it on 8 separate days; I would estimate I worked 4-5 hours on it at a time so in total around 40 hrs.


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I went to my discussion and talked to the TA about the resources I was using to make sure it was acceptable and clarifyed instructions with other students near me in discussion.
I also talked to the professor in class about validity checks for the site.


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
I don't believe so, if there's any disruptancies all work is identical to what is here: https://junel1e.github.io/
